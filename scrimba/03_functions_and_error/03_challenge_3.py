# Challenge: Returning functions
# For each function, save the result to a variable, then use the result to print an f string.

# 1. Write room_area(length, width) that returns the area of a room. Get the area of a
#    12 by 10 room.
#    Example output:
#    The room is 120 square feet.


def room_area(length, width):
    return length * width

area = room_area(12, 10)
print(f"The room is {area} square feet")


# 2. Write add_tax(price) that returns a price with 8% tax added (multiply by 1.08). Get
#    the total for a $50 item.
#    Example output:
#    With tax, that comes to $54.0.


def add_tax(price):
    tax = 8/100 * price
    total_price = price + tax
    return total_price 

print(f"With tax, that comes to {add_tax(50):.2f}")

# 3. Write full_name(first, last) that returns a first and last name joined with a space.
#    Use it to build a name, then print a greeting with it.
#    Example output:
#    Welcome, Mike Reed!


def full_name(first, last):
    name = first + " " + last
    return f"Welcome {name.title()}!"

print(full_name("Mike", "reed"))
